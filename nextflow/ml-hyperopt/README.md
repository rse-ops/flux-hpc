# Flux Nextflow Example

This is an example container where you can build (optional) and run
the [Nextflow Machine Learning](https://github.com/nextflow-io/ml-hyperopt) tutorial:

```bash
$ docker build -t nextflow .
```

or with a tag for the restful API:

```bash
$ docker build --no-cache --build-arg app="latest" -t nextflow .
```

Note that we tweak the [nextflow.config](nextflow.config) so that it runs with
Flux. If you get an error, you likely can grab the [latest from the repository](https://github.com/nextflow-io/ml-hyperopt/blob/master/nextflow.config) and be sure to add a profile for Flux:

```
profiles {
...
    flux {
        process.executor = 'flux'
        process.conda = "$baseDir/conda.yml"
        flux {
            terminalOutput = true
        }
    }
```

Note that `process.terminalOutput = true` is needed for flux to be able to see the log output!

## Running the Workflow

### RESTFul API and Interface

To use the Flux RESTFul API and interface:

```bash
$ docker run -it -p 5000:5000 nextflow
```

Requiring a Flux user/token (fluxuser and 12345)

```bash
$ docker run -it --env require_auth=true -p 5000:5000 nextflow
```

And then enter the fluxuser and 123456 as the user and token, and try submitting a job to
the examples like:

```console
# Potential command and workdir
# command: nextflow -c nextflow.config run main.nf -profile flux
# launcher (checked)
# workdir: /workflow
```

It's important to check that you are using a launcher (nextflow) that will be doing
the job submisson. Likely running the command with flux would work fine in a larger cluster
environment, but in our single container it would freeze.

You'll notice you don't get an ID back, but an instruction to look at the table.

![img/table.png](img/table.png)

The reason is because Nextflow has submit many flux jobs on our behalf!
If you click on a job, given that you've set the `terminalOutput` to be true,
in the nextflow configuration, you should see logs:

You'll also see the output from the main calling process in the terminal:


```console
...
>  flux (14)
[3e/e2342b] process > fetch_dataset (wdbc)    [100%] 1 of 1 ✔
[67/fc202f] process > split_train_test (wdbc) [100%] 1 of 1 ✔
[c9/6cca01] process > visualize (2)           [100%] 2 of 2 ✔
[f9/bf911b] process > train (wdbc/mlp)        [100%] 5 of 5 ✔
[84/ba10a7] process > predict (wdbc/mlp)      [100%] 5 of 5 ✔
The best model for wdbc was rf, with r2 = 0.8922882819942839
```

You can also try using the [RESTFul API](https://flux-framework.org/flux-restful-api/getting_started/user-guide.html#getting-started-user-guide--page-root). Have fun!

### Manual

Or just shell into the container:

```bash
$ docker run -it --entrypoint bash nextflow
```

Activate the environment:

```bash
$ micromamba shell init --shell=bash --prefix=~/micromamba
$ source /root/.bashrc
$ eval $(micromamba shell hook --shell=bash)
$ micromamba activate nf
```

And then start the flux instance:

```bash
$ flux start --test-size=4
```

And go to the nextflow workflow, and run it with Flux!

```bash
$ cd /workflow
$ nextflow -c nextflow.config run main.nf -profile flux
```
That's it!
